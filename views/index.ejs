            <p class="question">What is the Yield Curve?</p>
            <p class="answer"> The yield curve is just a graph showing the relationship
                between short term and long term interest rates of U.S.
                There are three main types of yield curve shapes:
                normal (upward sloping curve), inverted (downward
                sloping curve) and flat.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="question">Why do people care about the Yield Curve?</p>
            <p class="answer"> A Treasury note is essentially lending money to the government.
                The risk of letting the government hold on that money for a longer
                period of time is usually compensated by a higher: higher
                interest rates. Hence, the short term rate is usually lower than 
                the long term one which gives rise to a normal tield curve. 

                But sometimes this relationship changes. If the long term rate
                dips below the short term rate, the yield curve inverts and the
                market is concerned about it because it suggests the economy is
                heading into a recession. 
            </p>
        <div>
            <p class="question">Is the Yield Curve a good predictor of economic recession?</p>
            <p class="answer"> Arturo Estrella is one of the economists who helped discover the
                predictive power of the yield curve while working with a colleague at the
                Federal Reserve Bank of New York
                The U.S. Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred measure to gauge an inverted
                yield curve is the difference between the 10-year and 3-month treasury
                yields. To ensure that short-term fluctuations in interest rates are excluded,
                the Fed considers the yield curve to have inverted only when the difference
                in yields for these two securities remains negative for ten consecutive days.
                
                But many in the finance world also watch the difference between the 2 year
                and 10 year rates closely.
                The New York Fed research focused on a three month ten year.
                They feel that that has the most predictive power.
                The inverted yield curve has consistently predicted a recession
                each of the 5 times in the last 5 decades. Although, a recession
                follows the inversion, the timing is uncertain.</p>
