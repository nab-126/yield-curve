## Description
Web App visualization of the US Treasury Yield Curve.

My personal interest in finance has led me to come across the yield curve in news articles several times. The more I read about it, the more intrigued I was and I decided to code a simple website to track the yield curve.

I had no experience building web applications. I certainly did not learn any web development in classes but acquired the required skills such as reading through documentation and debugging to build a simple website. After watching some Youtube tutorials, reading medium articles, coding and spending a little too much time on stackoverflow, I finally got something up and running. Some of the things I have learnt while working on this personal project are:

* HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Fetch API
* Promises, async and await
* Line chart with chart.js
* Load JSON data with fetch() and update DOM element
* Node, npm and express - setting up a server to host static pages and learning the basics of server-side and client-side programming

## Roadmap
This project is still under development and there are many features I would like to add in the future. For example, I would like to save the different treasury rates to a database and plot a chart of how the difference between the 10-year and 3-month treasury yields changed and show periods of recession on the chart. I would also like to add the S&P500 index to the same chart. This will allow me to learn to work with time-series data and databases.
